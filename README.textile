WeatherNOOK is an Android weather app optimized for the Barnes & Noble NOOK Tablet. Weather 
information is sourced from NOAA. METAR station XML feeds are used for the current observations,
and the NDFD XML REST interface is used for forecast information.

The icons are from the "OpenIcons":http://openiconlibrary.sourceforge.net/ project. Much of the
initial NOAA REST interface is source from Jeffrey Sharkey's "Android Sky":http://code.google.com/p/android-sky/ 
project.
